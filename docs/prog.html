        <p>Progressive rock or prog was a sub-genere of rock created mostly in England in the mid to late 1960s. I was a departure from the norms of popular music at the time with its experimental features, lenghty conceptual pieces, and extreme technical complexity, often drawing on classical music, mythology, and literature as influences as well as other more common themes.</p>
